Let us insist to R that what we have is a matrix.
mat <- as.matrix(mydata)
class(mat)
nrow(mat)
ncol(mat)

mat[8:1]
mat[1:4, 1:2]

mean(mat[, 3])
median(mat[, 3])
sd(mat[,3])

mydata[1:2]

#R has many statistical tests built in. A classic test is the t test. Do the means of two vectors differ significantly?

mat[1,]
mat[2,]
t.test(mat[1,], mat[2,])

#Actually, this can be considered a paired sample t-test, since the values can be paired up by operator. By default t.test performs an unpaired t test. We see in the documentation (?t.test) that we can give paired=TRUE as an argument in order to perform a paired t-test.

t.test(mat[1,], mat[2,], paired=TRUE)

#When we call t.test it returns an object that behaves like a list. Recall that in R a list is a miscellaneous collection of data.

result$p.value

#This means we can write software that uses the various results from t-test, for example performing a whole series of t-tests and reporting the significant results.

library(sqldf)
V2<-sqldf("SELECT" * FROM mydata where V2 = '1'")
V2<-sqldf("SELECT * FROM mydata where V2 = '1'")
